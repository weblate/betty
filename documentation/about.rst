Philosophy
----------
Betty builds sites that tell a story. Raw family data is visualized in different, sometimes interactive ways.
Additional information is added automatically from a variety of third-party sources, augmenting your family trees
with further encyclopedic information, imagery, and maps.

Name
----
Betty was named after `Liberta "Betty" Lankester <https://ancestry.bartfeenstra.com/en/person/I0004/>`_, grandmother
to the original project author.

What is Betty not?
------------------
Betty does not help you gather or manage the data for your family history. For that purpose, use a product such as
`Gramps <https://gramps-project.org>`_, or a service like `Ancestry.com <https://www.ancestry.com>`_.
